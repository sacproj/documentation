You should use the method that works best for your use case.\n Command Line    CLI Installation    Installation Requirements    The sac command line is a Bash 4.x script targeting Linux, macOS, and WSL. It requires bash, coreutils, git, hugo, jq, tree and yq.\n$ brew install bash coreutils git hugo jq tree yq In order to install these tools with another method, please follow related documentation:\n bash version 4.x and above coreutils version 8.x and above git version 2.x and above hugo version 0.80 and above jq version 1.6 and above tree version 1.8.0 and above yq version 4.x and above  Homebrew    To download and install the latest version of sac command line, Homebrew can be used on Linux, macOS, and WSL.\n$ brew install sacproj/sac/sac Tarball    When installing from the tarball, you have to decide where to install the sac script (e.g /usr/local/bin).\n Download the tarball sac-cli.tar.gz from releases page. Unpack the tarball and copy sac script where you decide  Checking Installation    Execute following command to check requirements.\n$ sac doctor For each tool, sac doctor command checks the presence of it and outputs OK or KO as result. You have to install missing tools in order to get sac command line to work as expected.\nCLI in Container Image    An alternative way of using sac command-line is to use the container image available at sacproj/sac. It could be used with following function.\nfunction sac() { \\  docker run --rm \\  -e SAC_DECK_CODE_HUGO_ARGS=\u0026#34;--bind 0.0.0.0\u0026#34; \\  -v $(pwd):/home/linuxbrew/sac \\  -v $HOME/.sac/themes:/usr/local/share/sac/themes \\  -p 1313:1313 \\  -w /home/linuxbrew/sac \\  -it sacproj/sac:2.0.6 sac \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34;; } Theme Installation    In order to install latest Slides as Code Theme, execute following command:\n$ sac theme install github sacproj/sac-theme Then, check installed themes by executing following command:\n$ sac theme installed /usr/local/share/sac/themes └── sac └── x.y.z Create new Presentation    Create a new slides Deck with Slides as Code theme in my-awesome-slides directory:\n$ sac deck new my-awesome-slides sac-theme/x.y.z Go to created repository\n$ cd my-awesome-slides Slides content can be split into multiple Markdown files.\nSo, create few new content files to organize your slides deck:\n$ sac content new cover.md my-awesome-slides/content/home/cover.md created $ sac content new intro.md my-awesome-slides/content/home/intro.md created $ sac content new info.md my-awesome-slides/content/home/info.md created $ sac content new qa.md my-awesome-slides/content/home/qa.md created Thereby, the directory layout of your slides deck is following:\nmy-awesome-slides/ ├── .gitignore ├── .vscode │ └── sac.code-snippets ├── config.yaml ├── content │ └── home │ ├── cover.md │ ├── info.md │ ├── intro.md │ └── qa.md └── static ├── charts ├── codes ├── diagrams ├── images ├── sessions ├── sounds └── videos  content/home directory contains the just created Markdown files. Directories inside static will contain elements such as images, source code used by the slides deck. config.yaml contains the slides deck configuration (see Configuration page). sac.code.snippets contains VS Code snippets used by selected themes (see Snippets page).

The command sac content new is incrementing its value by 10 at every execution.\nSlides delimiters    Reveal.js supports slides organization in 2D. During deck presentation, type O key to show slides organization. Regarding navigation, Slides as Code disables 2D navigation and prefers to use linear navigation through all slides (both horizontal and vertical).\nMultiple slides could be put into a same content file.\n--- or ------ are the delimiters to separate each slide within the same content file.\n 3 dashes (---) to create a new slide on the right side (horizontal slides). 6 dashes (------) to create a new slide on the below side (vertical slides).  When building slides deck, content files are concatenated with horizontal separation.\nExamples\nFollowing example creates horizontal slides\n--- weight: \u0026lt;level\u0026gt; markup: \u0026#34;html\u0026#34; --- Slide 1 content --- Slide 2 content --- Slide 3 content Following example creates vertical slides\n--- weight: \u0026lt;level\u0026gt; markup: \u0026#34;html\u0026#34; --- Slide 1 content ------ Slide 1.1 content ------ Slide 1.2 content Speaker Notes    Reveal.js comes with a speaker notes plugin which can be used to present per-slide notes in a separate browser window. The notes window also gives you a preview of the next upcoming slide so it may be helpful even if you haven\u0026rsquo;t written any notes. Press the S key on your keyboard to open the notes window.\nA speaker timer starts as soon as the speaker view is opened. You can reset it to 00:00:00 at any time by simply clicking/tapping on it.\nNotes are defined by appending \u0026ldquo;Note:\u0026rdquo; segment to a slide content followed by Markdown text.\nExample Following example creates slides with notes\n--- weight: \u0026lt;level\u0026gt; markup: \u0026#34;html\u0026#34; --- Slide 1 content Note: Slide 1 Notes ------ Slide 1.1 content Note: Slide 1.1 Notes ------ Slide 1.2 content Note: Slide 1.2 Notes "},{"id":3,"href":"/documentation/usage/markdown/","title":"Markdown","parent":"Usage","content":"    Introduction Element Attributes Slide Attributes Tips \u0026amp; Tricks     Introduction    Slides as Code is a Hugo theme that uses Markdown and Shortcodes to implement slides content.
